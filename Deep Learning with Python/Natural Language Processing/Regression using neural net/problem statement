Another common type of machine learning problem is "regression", which consists of predicting a continuous value instead of a discrete label. For instance, 
predicting the temperature tomorrow, given meteorological data, or predicting the time that a software project will take to complete, given its specifications.

Do not mix up "regression" with the algorithm "logistic regression": confusingly, "logistic regression" is not a regression algorithm, it is a classification 
algorithm.

The Boston Housing Price dataset
We will be attempting to predict the median price of homes in a given Boston suburb in the mid-1970s, given a few data points about the suburb at the time, 
such as the crime rate, the local property tax rate, etc.

The dataset we will be using has another interesting difference from our two previous examples: it has very few data points, only 506 in total, split between 
404 training samples and 102 test samples, and each "feature" in the input data (e.g. the crime rate is a feature) has a different scale. For instance some 
values are proportions, which take a values between 0 and 1, others take values between 1 and 12, others between 0 and 100...
