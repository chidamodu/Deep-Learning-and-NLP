In this section, we will build a network to classify Reuters newswires into 46 different mutually-exclusive topics. Since we have many classes, this problem is an 
instance of "multi-class classification", and since each data point should be classified into only one category, the problem is more specifically an instance of 
"single-label, multi-class classification". If each data point could have belonged to multiple categories (in our case, topics) then we would be facing a 
"multi-label, multi-class classification" problem.

We will be working with the Reuters dataset, a set of short newswires and their topics, published by Reuters in 1986. It's a very simple, widely used toy dataset 
for text classification. There are 46 different topics; some topics are more represented than others, but each topic has at least 10 examples in the training set. 
Like IMDB and MNIST, the Reuters dataset comes packaged as part of Keras.
