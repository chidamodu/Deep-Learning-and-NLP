    "1. Suppose you learn a word embedding for a vocabulary of 10000 words. Then the embedding vectors should be 10000 dimensional, so as to capture the full range of variation and meaning in those words.\n",
    "\n",
    "\tFalse\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What is t-SNE?\n",
    "\n",
    "\tA non-linear dimensionality reduction technique\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Suppose you download a pre-trained word embedding which has been trained on a huge corpus of text. You then use this word embedding to train an RNN for a language task of recognizing if someone is happy from a short snippet of text, using a small training set.\n",
    "x (input text)\ty (happy?)\n",
    "I'm feeling wonderful today!\t1\n",
    "I'm bummed my cat is ill.\t0\n",
    "Really enjoying this!\t1\n",
    "Then even if the word “ecstatic” does not appear in your small training set, your RNN might reasonably be expected to recognize “I’m ecstatic” as deserving a label y = 1y=1.\n",
    "\n",
    "\tTrue\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Which of these equations do you think should hold for a good word embedding? (Check all that apply)\n",
    "\n",
    "\te_{boy} - e_{girl} ≈ e_{brother} - e_{sister}\n",
    "\te_{boy} - e_{brother} ≈ e_{girl} - e_{sister} \n",
    "\n",
    "5. Let EE be an embedding matrix, and let o1234 be a one-hot vector corresponding to word 1234. Then to get the embedding of word 1234, why don’t we call E∗o1234 in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "\tIt is computationally wasteful.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. When learning word embeddings, we create an artificial task of estimating P(target \\mid context)P(target∣context).\n",
    "It is okay if we do poorly on this artificial prediction task; the more important by-product of this task is that we\n",
    "learn a useful set of word embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "\tTrue\n",
    "\n",
    "7. In the word2vec algorithm, you estimate P(t \\mid c)P(t∣c), where tt is the target word and cc is a context word. How are tt and cc chosen from the training set? Pick the best answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "\tcc and tt are chosen to be nearby words.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Suppose you have a 10000 word vocabulary, and are learning 500-dimensional word embeddings. The word2vec model uses the following softmax function:\n",
    "P(t∣c)=eθTtec∑10000t′=1eθTt′ec\n",
    "Which of these statements are correct? Check all that apply.\n",
    "\n",
    "\tθt and ec are both 500 dimensional vectors.\n",
    "\tθt and ec are both trained with an optimization algorithm such as Adam or gradient descent.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Suppose you have a 10000 word vocabulary, and are learning 500-dimensional word embeddings.The GloVe model minimizes this objective:\n",
    "min∑10,000i=1∑10,000j=1f(Xij)(θTiej+bi+b′j−logXij)2\n",
    "Which of these statements are correct? Check all that apply.\n",
    "\n",
    "\tθi and ej hould be initialized randomly at the beginning of training.\n",
    "\tXij is the number of times word i appears in the context of word j.\n",
    "\tThe weighting function f(.)f(.) must satisfy f(0) = 0f(0)=0.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. You have trained word embeddings using a text dataset of m1 words. You are considering using these word embeddings for a language task, for which you have a separate labeled dataset of m2 words. Keeping in mind that using word embeddings is a form of transfer learning, under which of these circumstance would you expect the word embeddings to be helpful?\n",
