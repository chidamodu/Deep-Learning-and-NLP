In this project, you will learn how to analyze a dataset for sentiment analysis. You will learn how to read in a PyTorch BERT model, and adjust 
the architecture for multi-class classification. 

You will learn how to adjust an optimizer and scheduler for ideal training and performance. In fine-tuning this model, you will learn how to design a train and 
evaluate loop to monitor model performance as it trains, including saving and loading models. 

Finally, you will build a Sentiment Analysis model that leverages BERT's large-scale language knowledge.
