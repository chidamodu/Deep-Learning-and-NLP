Now we will build and train a bi-directional LSTM neural network to recognize named entities in text data. We will accomplish it by completing each task in the 
project:

Task 1: Project Overview and Import Modules
Task 2 : Load and Explore the NER Dataset
Task 3: Retrieve Sentences and Corresponding Tags
Task 4: Define Mappings between Sentences and Tags
Task 5: Padding Input Sentences and Creating Train/Test Splits
Task 6: Build and Compile a Bidirectional LSTM Model
Task 7: Train the Model
Task 8: Evaluate Named Entity Recognition Model

While you are watching me work on each step, you will get a cloud desktop with all the required software pre-installed. This will allow you to follow along the 
instructions to complete the above mentioned tasks. After all, we learn best with active, hands-on learning.
